# LEETCODE-Trees-2331
Your `evaluateTree` method seems to be evaluating a binary tree where each node either holds the value 0, 1, or 2. A node with value 0 represents false, 1 represents true, and 2 represents an operator.

Here's a dry run of how your code works:

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean evaluateTree(TreeNode root) {
    if (root.val < 2)
      return root.val == 1; // If it's a leaf node, return its boolean value (true/false)

    if (root.val == 2) // If it's an operator node
      return evaluateTree(root.left) || evaluateTree(root.right); // OR operator if value is 2

    return evaluateTree(root.left) && evaluateTree(root.right); // AND operator if value is 3
  }
}
```

Let's say we have a tree like this:

```
      2
     / \
    0   1
```

This tree represents "(false OR true)".

1. We start with the root, which has a value of 2 (an operator). So, we move to its left child and evaluate it.
2. The left child has a value of 0 (false), so it returns false.
3. Since the OR operator is used, we also evaluate the right child.
4. The right child has a value of 1 (true), so it returns true.
5. The OR of false and true is true, so the final result of the expression is true.

Thus, the method returns true.

For more complex trees, it will continue evaluating in a similar manner, recursively descending the tree until it reaches leaf nodes or the desired result is obtained.
